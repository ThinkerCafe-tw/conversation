			"taskId": 1,
			"taskTitle": "設置專案基礎架構與開發環境",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand task 1 into subtasks covering: 1) Git repository and code quality setup, 2) GCP services configuration, 3) CI/CD pipeline implementation, and 4) Documentation and environment configuration.",
			"reasoning": "This task involves setting up multiple infrastructure components across different platforms (Git, GCP services, CI/CD). It requires coordination between various services and configuration of multiple environments, making it moderately complex."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 2,
			"taskTitle": "實現 LINE Bot 整合與訊息接收",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 3,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand task 2 into subtasks covering: 1) LINE Bot channel setup and configuration, 2) Webhook implementation for message events, and 3) Group management event handling (join/leave).",
			"reasoning": "This task requires integration with an external API (LINE) and implementing event-driven logic. The complexity comes from handling different event types and ensuring proper webhook configuration, but the scope is well-defined with clear examples provided."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 3,
			"taskTitle": "實現用戶匿名化模組",
			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 3,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand task 3 into subtasks covering: 1) Redis configuration for user mapping storage, 2) Pseudonym generation and retrieval logic, and 3) TTL implementation for data lifecycle management.",
			"reasoning": "This task involves implementing a stateful system with Redis and ensuring proper data lifecycle. The complexity is moderate as it requires careful handling of user mappings and ensuring consistent pseudonym assignment within time windows."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 4,
			"taskTitle": "實現對話暫存系統",
			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 3,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand task 4 into subtasks covering: 1) Redis Sorted Set implementation for time-series message storage, 2) Message formatting and storage functions, and 3) Message retrieval by time range functionality.",
			"reasoning": "Similar to task 3, this involves Redis implementation but with Sorted Sets for time-series data. The complexity comes from ensuring proper time-based storage and retrieval, with automatic expiration of data."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 5,
			"taskTitle": "實現定時觸發系統",
			"complexityScore": 4,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 2,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand task 5 into subtasks covering: 1) Cloud Scheduler configuration and secure endpoint setup, and 2) Task queue implementation for summary generation jobs.",
			"reasoning": "This task is relatively straightforward, involving Cloud Scheduler configuration and a secure API endpoint. The main complexity is in ensuring proper authentication and handling the task queue to prevent system overload."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 6,
			"taskTitle": "整合 Google Gemini API 實現 AI 摘要生成",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand task 6 into subtasks covering: 1) Gemini API integration setup, 2) Prompt engineering and optimization, 3) Conversation formatting for AI processing, and 4) Error handling and retry mechanisms.",
			"reasoning": "This task involves AI integration which adds significant complexity. Prompt engineering requires iterative refinement, and the system needs to handle API limitations, rate limits, and potential failures. Ensuring quality summaries adds another layer of complexity."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 7,
			"taskTitle": "實現摘要發送功能",
			"complexityScore": 4,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 2,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand task 7 into subtasks covering: 1) LINE message formatting and sending implementation, and 2) Error handling and retry mechanism for failed message delivery.",
			"reasoning": "This task is relatively straightforward, involving sending formatted messages back to LINE groups. The main complexity comes from proper error handling and implementing retry mechanisms for failed deliveries."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 8,
			"taskTitle": "實現完整的端到端流程",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 3,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand task 8 into subtasks covering: 1) Message processing pipeline integration, 2) Summary generation workflow implementation, and 3) System-wide error handling and logging.",
			"reasoning": "This integration task has significant complexity as it requires connecting all previous components into a cohesive system. Ensuring proper data flow, error handling, and state management across the entire application increases complexity."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 9,
			"taskTitle": "實現監控與日誌系統",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 3,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand task 9 into subtasks covering: 1) Cloud Monitoring setup and metric definition, 2) Structured logging implementation, and 3) Alert configuration and management API.",
			"reasoning": "Implementing a comprehensive monitoring system requires integration with Cloud Monitoring, defining appropriate metrics, and setting up alerting. The complexity comes from ensuring proper coverage of system performance without exposing sensitive data."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 10,
			"taskTitle": "實施安全與隱私保護措施",
			"complexityScore": 9,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand task 10 into subtasks covering: 1) Secret management and API security, 2) Data lifecycle implementation and privacy controls, 3) Network security and encryption, and 4) Security audit and vulnerability remediation.",
			"reasoning": "Security implementation is highly complex as it spans across all system components. It requires expertise in multiple security domains (authentication, encryption, data privacy) and must be implemented without compromising system functionality or performance."
